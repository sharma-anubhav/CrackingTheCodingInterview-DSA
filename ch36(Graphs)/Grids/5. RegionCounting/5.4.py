Surrounded Regions
You are given an m x n matrix board containing the characters 'X' and 'O'.
You need to capture regions that are completely surrounded by 'X'.
Definitions:
    Connect: 
        Two cells are connected if they are adjacent horizontally or vertically.
    Region: 
        A region is a group of 'O' cells connected together.
    Surrounded Region: 
        A region is surrounded if none of its 'O' cells touch the border (edges of the board).
    To capture such a region:
        Replace all 'O's in that region with 'X' â€” in place.
        You do not need to return anything.
