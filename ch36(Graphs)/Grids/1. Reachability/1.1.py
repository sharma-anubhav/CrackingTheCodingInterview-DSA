"""
Connectivity Problem. We cna use DFS/BFS but prefer DFS. 
DFS goes to each and every node! (not all paths remember)
Hence it can give a path if there exists. but not optimal

"""
ðŸ§© Problem Statement
You are given a square grid of size n Ã— n, where each cell contains one of the following values:
    0 â†’ Wall (cannot move through)
    1 â†’ Source (starting point)
    2 â†’ Destination (ending point)
    3 â†’ Blank cell (can move through)
You can move up, down, left, or right from a cell â€” but cannot move diagonally or through walls.
Your task is to determine whether there exists a path from the source to the destination.

Return:
    1 if a path exists
    0 if no path exists
