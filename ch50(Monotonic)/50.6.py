Problem 6: Largest Rectangle
You have an nÃ—n mosaic made of blue and red tiles, where n > 0. 
You are given an array of integers, tiles, of length n, where tiles[i] indicates the number of blue tiles in column i of the mosaic (columns are 0-indexed). 
For each column, all the blue tiles are contiguously at the bottom, and the red tiles are contiguously at the top.

Return the size of the largest rectangle that can be formed using only blue tiles. The rectangle cannot contain partial tiles.
